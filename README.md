This is a final project presenting the training and use of yolov5 model as a face detector + dlib based face recognizer, based on a custome training done to yolov5s and face resource folser
it works by adding the wanted face photo to faces folder and naming it the way you want it to be presented.
if there are too many faces in the folder the processing is slower. 
future steps are embedding this on Rspi to make a smart door camera with ability to ditact multiple face instances each frame
